## GDScript Cautions

### Enum classes

GDScript doesn't report this error (comparing variants of incompatible types):

```
print(PS3ItemCategory.WEAPON == PS3ItemType.KNIFE)
```

## Character data

- [ ] Correct level
- [ ] Correct statistics
- [ ] Correct learned techniques
- [ ] Correct `can_equip`
- [ ] Correct `status_if_equipped`

## Technique implementation

- [ ] Correct cost
- [ ] Correct `is_targetted_healing_tech`
- [ ] Correct `healing_tech_restored_hp`
- [ ] Correct `available_on_camp`
- [ ] Correct `game_data.use_tech`
- [ ] If a targetted opponent isn't available anymore, choose another. This can happen with macros.

## Scrolling

- [ ] Scroll descriptions such as tech descriptions using the right controller analog.

## Item and techinique descriptions

- [ ] Implemented

## Internationalization

- Sometimes a label's font size might need to be decreased depending on text length. This varies per display locale.
  - Round big buttons are included, for example.

## Accessibility

- Default keyboard keys:
  - ASDW or arrows for UI directions and character movement
  - J, Z, Space or Enter for OK
  - K, X or Escape for cancel
  - P or Escape for pause
- Support touchscreen, keyboard and controller.
- Consider using the `ui_accept` action.

## Macros

- [ ] Save macros

## Dialogs

- [ ] Accept `ui_accept` for advancing messages or confirmation.
- [ ] Use a vertical scroll container in the message dialog, but hide the scroll bar.

## Pause

- [ ] Clicking out of pause menu should collapse it.
  - Not implemented because this conflicts with the pause button.
- [ ] Character
  - [ ] Tech
  - [ ] Equipment
    - [ ] Use horizontal directionals to switch between weapons, shields etc.
    - [ ] Display damage, defense and speed reactively
- [ ] System
  - [ ] Save Game
  - [ ] Return to Main Menu

## Gameplay
