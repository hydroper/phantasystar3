# Plan

## Internationalization

- Sometimes a label's font size might need to be decreased depending on text length. This varies per display locale.
  - Round big buttons are included, for example.

## Accessibility

- Default keyboard keys:
  - ASDW or arrows for UI directions and character movement
  - J, Z, Space or Enter for OK
  - K, X or Escape for cancel
  - P or Escape for pause
- Support touchscreen, keyboard and controller.
- Consider using the `ui_accept` action.

## Dialogs

- [ ] Accept `ui_accept` for advancing messages or confirmation.

## Pause

- [ ] Clicking out of pause menu should collapse it.
  - Not implemented because this conflicts with the pause button.
- [ ] Character
  - [ ] Tech
  - [ ] Equipment
    - [ ] Use horizontal directionals to switch between weapons, shields etc.
    - [ ] Display damage, defense and speed reactively
- [ ] System
  - [ ] Save Game
  - [ ] Return to Main Menu

## Gameplay

- [ ] During progress, ask whether to save game. This may be useful if the player forgets going to `System > Save Game`
