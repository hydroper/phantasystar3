# Phantasy Star 3

Work-in-progress (still very early, beginning at the UI) for a fan remake of Phantasy Star III. This Godot project belongs to me, but the original Phantasy Star III belongs to Sega.

The game will be playable on desktop and mobile and through controllers.

## Assets

The project temporarily uses sprite resources from the classics until they are redesigned by some artist:
